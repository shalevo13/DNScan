## Test Descriptions

### Zone Transfer (AXFR)
**Severity:** Critical  
Checks if unauthorized zone transfers are allowed. If vulnerable, attackers can retrieve all DNS records.

### SPF Record
**Severity:** Medium  
Verifies the presence of Sender Policy Framework records to prevent email spoofing.

### DMARC Record
**Severity:** Medium  
Checks for Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance records.

### Wildcard DNS
**Severity:** Low  
Detects wildcard DNS configurations that may be used for phishing attacks.

### MX Records
**Severity:** Medium  
Validates that mail exchanger records point to resolvable hosts.

### CNAME Takeover Risk
**Severity:** High  
Identifies external CNAME targets that could be vulnerable to subdomain takeover.

### Nameserver Health
**Severity:** High  
Ensures all nameservers are properly configured and reachable.

## Original CLI Tool

The original command-line tool is still available in `potential_dns_vuln_tester.py`:

```bash
python potential_dns_vuln_tester.py example.com
```

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **DNS Library:** dnspython
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
